"""Generate a Spotify playlist containing your top 50 songs of the past month.

Usage:
    python ammo.py <Client ID> <Client Secret> <Redirect URI> <username> <scope>
    TODO: Arguments have not yet been created; these are currently hard-coded.

Outline:
    Authenticate the user's Spotify credentials to allow the script to work.
    Check if a playlist exists for the past month, exiting the script if so.
    Use the user's credentials to pull HTML data containing their top songs.
    Jump to the 4th ol in the parsed HTML, which contains the relevant data.
    Store the nested il elements as a list, stripping irrelevant characters.
    Send the user's list of songs to the Spotify API to generate a playlist.

References:
    See https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ for API info.
