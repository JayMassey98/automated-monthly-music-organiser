Usage:
    python ammo.py <Client ID> <Client Secret> <Redirect URI>

Outline:
    Authenticate Spotify credentials to access https://favoritemusic.guru/.
    Jump to the 4th ol in the pulled data, which contains the relevant data.
    Store the nested il elements as a list, stripping irrelevant characters.
    Check if a playlist exists for the past month, exiting the script if so.
    Send the contents of the list to the Spotify API to generate a playlist.

References:
    See https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ for API info.
